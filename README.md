Abstractâ€”This paper aims to address the early detection and identification of fires, proposing a deep learning-based fire classification and detection model named FireScene Identification and Classification Network, FICNet for short. The model analyzes the publicly available aerial imagery dataset from FlameVision to rapidly classify and detect wildfires. This paper provides a detailed introduction to the dataset, model construction, experimental procedures, and results, while also discussing the practical application value and future research directions of the model. The FlameVision dataset and the FICNet model have been publicly released at https://github.com/vzhb/FICNet .

The FICNet model's network architecture consists of five layers:

  LAYER 1: Input layer, receiving 416x416 images.
  
  LAYER 2: Pre-trained layer, Utilizing the pre-trained ResNet50 model, excluding the top fully connected layer, and using average pooling to reduce the dimensionality of feature maps.
  
  LAYER 3: Global Average Pooling layer, Performing global average pooling to further reduce the dimensionality of feature maps, allowing them to be input to the fully connected layer.
  
  LAYER 4: Fully connected layer, A fully connected layer with softmax activation function, also known as the dense layer, used for the classification task. Here, it is assumed that there are two classes, but the number can be adjusted according to the needs.
  
  LAYER 5: Output layer, displaying the final classification results.
