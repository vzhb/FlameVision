The code in this toolbox implements the ["Cross-City Matters: A Multimodal Remote Sensing Benchmark Dataset for Cross-City Semantic Segmentation using High-Resolution Domain Adaptation Networks"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425723004078). A new set of multimodal RS benchmark datasets (C2Seg) is built for the study purpose of the cross-city semantic segmentation task. The C2Seg datasets can also be used for organizing the  ["WHISPERS2023 Challenge 1: CROSS-CITY MULTIMODAL SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION CHALLENGE"](https://www.ieee-whispers.com/cross-city-challenge/).
